I was inspired to write this book in the way I have done by a couple of great online books.

*   [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/ "Resilient Web Design by Jeremy Keith: online book") by Jeremy Keith, which I love as an ageing techie, but also for its explemary and thoughtful presentation.
*   [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/ "Meaningness by David Chapman: online book") by David Chapman, from which I've taken much inspration not just in terms of its ideas, but also its incredibly clever design - little touches like the implementation of comments and highlighting of unfinished content.
