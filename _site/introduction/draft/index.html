<p>Moby Dick is a novel that tells us that life and the universe are amazing, extraordinary and worthy of awe.  It is not a novel that reassures that life and the universe are nice or pleasant or that everything will be fine, unless your definition of what is fine can encompass inevitable death.  It is not a novel that tells us that love is all we need, or that love will be sufficient, but it is a novel that is full of love.</p>
