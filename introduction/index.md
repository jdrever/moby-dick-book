I think Herman Melville's Moby Dick can be viewed as a survival guide to the twenty first century.

In this book, I will try to explain why Moby Dick is such a potentially helpful and important resource at this particular point in history.  One way of seeing Moby Dick is to understand it as a survivor's story: a retrospective description of being stuck on a boat headed towards its own destruction.  A lot of people on the boat fear that their story won't end well, but they are led to their doom by their monomaniacal leader.  This demented leader thinks he can wreak revenge on the natural world.  The natural world wins.  There is only one survivor, but the survivor returns with knowledge and perspectives that have aided his survival.

While I'll be arguing strongly that Moby Dick is a useful survival guide, I don't expect or want you to fully trust me.  Part of the point of this book is to suggest that any perspective on anything is at best partial.  Any form of guide, this one included, is to be treated with extreme caution, particularly if it attempts to provide a final viewpoint.

## Statements of Intent
Before I start, here are some general statements of intent, particularly intentions about trying to make this book accessible to anyone who is interested:
- This online version of the book will always be freely available</li>
- Moby Dick is also <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2489" target="_blank" title="Moby Dick on Project Gutenberg">freely available online</a> (as HTML, ePub and Kindle formats) courtesy of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page" title="Project Gutenberg home page">Project Gutenberg</a> They may not be the most visually ravishing presentations of the text, but all the words at there. All links in this online book will go to the Project Gutenberg online HTML version of the book.  There is also a slightly more visually ravishing and equally free eBook version of Moby Dick via <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville/moby-dick" title="StandardEBook version of Moby Dick">StandardEBooks</a> 
- Herman Melville's extraordinary letters to Nathaniel Hawthorne are also <a href="http://www.melville.org/corresp.htm">available online</a>
- I want to write in a way that the widest possible set of readers can follow.  I have read too much modern literary critcism that, even as an over-educated middle class ponce, I can't bloody understand, because of it's use of abstract and difficult language. I definitely want to discuss complex ideas, but I want them to be explained and expressed as simply as possbile.  If you can't follow what I'm trying to say, please let me know (add a comment!) and I'll try to be clearer - that kind of feedback will be invaluable.
- I want to incorporate some perspectives (from spiritual and contemplative traditions, science and the recent meta-modern movement) that are not often included in literary criticism.  I don't want to just reference academic texts, I want to also reference podcasts and blogs, which is where much of the interesting thinking is currently happening.
- I want to lay bear some of the mechanisms of writing a book.  You can see when each section was last updated - what that means is at that particular moment in time, this is what I felt was closest to the truth of whatever I was trying to say.  You can also see the full version history of each section (click on the Updated link at the end of each section), and therefore see how that best approximation to the truth changed over time, which also suggests that what you read now may change in the future.
- I have also added reflections (sometimes personal) to some of the sections to present a different perspective on them.
- And there are references for each section, including links wherever possible so you can investigate the sources further.
- I also want to open the book up to comments - I would love to be told I've got something wrong and be able to respond to that (possibly with something else that I've got wrong).  Please do get stuck in.

## Who is Hermam Melville?
Herman Melville, who was born in 1819 and died in 1891 was an American writer who produced a series of novels, short stories and poems.

Melville was born into a significant American family: two of his grandfathers were heroes of the American Revolution. The young Herman lived in prosperity until his father's business failed and his father died in 1832, when Herman was thirteen.

In 1839, Melville joined a merchant ship sailing from New York to Liverpool, and in January 1841 set off with a whaling ship headed to the South Pacific, and then had travelled through the South Pacific and South America on whaling boats, including involvement in a mutiny, and in the merchant navy.

After two successful partly auto-biographical novels, Typee (1846) and Omoo (1847) based on his adventures in the South Pacific, Melville's work was generally not well received in his own time. Mardi (1849) was a philopshical adventure set in the South Seas. Reburn (1849) fictionalised Melville's trip to Liverpool in 1839. Moby Dick (1852) is generally considered his masterpiece, but was not financially successful. After Moby Dick came the psychologically messy domestic drama Pierre (1852) and the Confidence Man (1857). From here, Melville turned to poetry, writing Battle Pieces (1865), centred on the American Civil War, and Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876).


## Why Does Moby Dick Matter?

Moby Dick has the slightly dusty reputation of a classic text, sometimes eulogised but rarely actually read. Caitlin Moran's perspective is I'm sure fairly typical: "Moby Dick makes me sad that I hadn't read it earlier in my life - I'd always thought it was basically some dull Hemingway-esque novel about fishing, and eschewed it on that basis." (How to Be Famous, Caitlin Moran) How can a long and meandering book about whaling published in 1851 have anything useful to say to a world defined by capitalism and overwhelmed by technology? How can a book with almost no female characters say anything of value to the 50% of the world's population that are almost entirely excluded from its pages?

I'm here to convince you that Moby Dick a genuinely eccentric and radical book, a story about the end of established ways of living and perspectives, and an exemplar in writing of how we could live differently. Funny, deviant, and gleaming with life. As Moran puts it:

Those long, bright pages are bursting with everything he knows—all that he has observed about waves, and wind, and men, and whale oil, and knives, and boats, and love, and fear. A burning desire to chronicle everything that he is, and knows, on the page, just to prove he existed. Just to prove you could be someone like Herman Melville, when everyone else in the world was not.

Moran goes on to imagine Melville, a man so apparently out of step with his own time, the "bearded clerk, who died without glory", existing in the twenty first century, going "to a bar with Queequeg" to drink cocktails, dance, talk about "theories of humanity" and listen to Astral Weeks (Van Morrison) which "they would have never heard and would think of as magic". It is certainly possible to think of Melville finding some sweet kinship with a song that ends "I'm nothing but a stranger in this world", and to agree that in certain ways (our relative and unequally distributed cultural and sexual freedom, for example) Melville might "love this world so much", and "have felt so at home here!".

_And all you could do was imagine it, and write it in your books, and then hide inside those books, and come talk to me, a hundred years later. That is where you live. A book is a beautiful, paper mausoleum, or tomb, in which to store ideas… to keep the bones of your thoughts in one place, for all time. I just want to say—“Hello. We can hear you. The words survived.”_

And this sense of Melville speaking to us across temporal and cultural divides, prenaturally aware of what was to come, is very much what I'm trying to express here. But I also need to emphasise the darker aspects of Melville's precognition - the sense in which the world in which we live in is the inevitable and terrible fulfillment of the world he lived in. And to suggest ways in which the "bones" of his thoughts littered in the "tomb" of Moby Dick are worth examining we try to work out what the hell to do next.

In his online book, Vividness, David Chapman argues for the importance of an attitude, which he calls "spacious passion", that he claims is the key to understanding Buddhist tantra. This attitude, I'm going to argue, is the key to understanding Moby Dick, and the key to understanding Moby Dick as a survival guide. There - I've said it now, and you can't stop reading if you want. The rest of this book will just be a painstaking unpicking of exactly what that means.

Assuming you're still with me, I'll continue. In what remains of this introduction, I want to do two things:

*   Lay out some of the key themes of Moby Dick, and introduce the idea that they have actually relate to some of the challenges that we currently face.
*   Introduce some of the different ways I'll be looking at Moby Dick
