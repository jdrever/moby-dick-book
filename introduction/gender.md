Moby Dick is a book about men. 
Search for paternal inheritance.   

"Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it."

- The devious cruising Rachel. 
- The step mother world

In the grand armada 
- All male crew, destructive and relentless activity
- Nursing whales, stillness and wonder.
